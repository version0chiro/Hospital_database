# Hospital_database
A web based hospital database system to store data of all the paitents active in the hospital hours. With all the important details, the active parameters will be used to predict the 
condition of the paitents in the upcoming days and send alert to the doctors if needed. The project is still under construction. The whole application is yet to be hosted, will update the link once that is done.
